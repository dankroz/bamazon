Here is a link for a video of the apps: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LxIk0hr3K8StW2cOBI1xbdjMvJuxAZkO/view?usp=sharing

PART I - bamazonCustomer
The idea for this app is to allow customer to view products, select them, and order them.

A user is able to view all products immediately seeing their name, product id and price. They are prompted to identify which product they'd like to order by id and how many units they would like to buy. 

If there is sufficient stock then the order goes through and tells the customer the full price that they are paying. If there is insufficient stock, it cancels the order and informs the customer.

This app is great for quick and efficient ordering for customers.

Here is a video showing it's functions: 

PART II - bamazonManager
The idea for this app is to allow Manage to view, check status of inventories, add to inventories and add products.

The manager starts the app and is prompted with the previously stated options. They will then be shown data or prompted with more options based on what they selected. 

This app is fantastic for management personel since it allows for oversite of stock and addition of products when necessary.
